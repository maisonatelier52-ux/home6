            "text": "The initial shock of ChatGPT has worn off, and we are entering the 'deployment' phase of the generative AI revolution. For the first two years, the race was about scale—more parameters, more data, more compute. But enterprises are finding that 'general' intelligence is often too expensive and too unpredictable for specific business use cases. The new trend is toward 'Vertical AI': small, highly optimized models trained on proprietary industry data. These models don't write poems; they audit legal contracts, optimize supply chain routes, and write code for legacy banking systems."

            "text": "The next frontier is 'Agentic AI.' Unlike a chat interface where a human must guide every step, autonomous agents are given a high-level goal and a set of tools (like access to email, databases, and web browsers) to achieve it. For example, a travel agent AI could not only suggest a flight but also book it, cancel your old hotel, and update your calendar—all while optimizing for your specific corporate travel policy. This shift from 'software as a tool' (SaaS) to 'software as a service' (Agentic AI) will fundamentally change the white-collar labor market."

            "type": "paragraph",
            "text": "However, this transition brings massive challenges in trust and safety. How do you ensure an agent doesn't overspend your budget or leak sensitive customer data? The 'alignment' problem is moving from the theoretical to the practical. Companies like Anthropic and OpenAI are investing billions into 'Constitutional AI' and 'RLHF' (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) to create guardrails that are as robust as the models themselves."

            "text": "Underpinning all of this is the physical reality of the GPU shortage. Nvidia remains the gatekeeper of the AI era, with its H200 and Blackwell chips in constant backorder. This scarcity is driving a wave of innovation in AI hardware. Startups like Groq are building specialized chips (LPUs) that can run these models 10x faster and more efficiently than traditional GPUs. We are also seeing a major push toward 'Edge AI'—running smaller models directly on smartphones and laptops to reduce latency and improve privacy. The future of AI is local."
