For two decades, we\u0027ve lived under the \u0027Grand Bargain\u0027: free services in exchange for endless surveillance. But regulators, led by the European Union\u0027s DMA and DSA, are tearing up that contract. They are demanding that users have real, granular control over their data, and that dominant platforms stop\u0027 self-preferencing\u0027 their own services. This is an existential threat to companies whose primary revenue comes from hyper-targeted advertising."

Meta, in response, is pivoting toward a \u0027Privacy-First Ad Stack\u0027 that uses differential privacy and on-device processing to target ads without ever seeing an individual\u0027s data. It is a technical feat, but critics argue it still centralizes too much power."

This mathematical breakthrough allows one party to prove to another that they know a piece of information without actually revealing the information itself. In the context of the web, this means I could prove I am over 18, or that I have a certain credit score, without the website ever seeing my ID or my bank balance. This \u0027Privacy-by-Design\u0027 approach is the future of the internet. The Quest for Profit is shifting from data exploitation to data protection."
