The trillion-dollar package includes significant funding for high-speed rail, broadband internet expansion in rural areas, and a nationwide network of electric vehicle charging stations. It is being hailed as the most significant investment in public works since the Eisenhower era."

The final compromise involves a mix of repurposed emergency funds, stricter tax enforcement on cryptocurrency, and a small levy on corporate stock buybacks.

The bill now heads to the House, where a swift passage is expected despite some grumbling from the fringes of both parties."
