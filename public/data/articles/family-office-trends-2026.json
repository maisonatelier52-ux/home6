For family offices (the private wealth management firms that serve ultra-wealthy families), this is a moment of existential change. The heirs have very different values from their parents. They are less interested in pure financial returns and more interested in\u0027 impact.\u0027 They want their family\u0027s capital to solve social problems, even if it means lower yields in the short term."

Family offices are having to hire \u0027Digital Estate Managers\u0027 to ensure this data isn\u0027t lost to time. One lost password can mean the permanent loss of millions in Bitcoin. The legal frameworks for this are still being written, making it a high-risk area for wealth preservation."
