For decades, the global elite were concentrated in a handful of \u0027Alpha Cities\u0027—New York, London, Hong Kong, and luxury enclaves like St. Tropez. But the post-pandemic world has reset priorities. Privacy, biological security, and environmental stability are the new status symbols. We are seeing a massive flight to \u0027Hidden Hubs\u0027: places like Telluride in Colorado, the Alentejo coast in Portugal, and certain islands in the Japanese archipelago."

This allows them to align their lifestyle with their ESG commitments (and their public image). Being a good steward of the land is the new way to show off."
