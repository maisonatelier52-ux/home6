The catalyst was the release of China's PMI data, which showed factory activity contracting at its fastest pace in three years.

The cartel had planned to unwind some of its voluntary production cuts next month, but the market is clearly signaling that there is no appetite for extra barrels. Delegates are reportedly holding emergency discussions, with Saudi Arabia pushing for an extension of the cuts to stabilize prices. However, smaller members, desperate for revenue, oppose further restrictions."
