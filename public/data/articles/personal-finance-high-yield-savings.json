With interest rates near zero, money in a traditional bank account was actually losing purchasing power due to inflation. That era is officially over. Today, High-Yield Savings Accounts (HYSAs) and Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are offering returns that actually exceed inflation, providing a \u0027risk-free\u0027 pillar for personal portfolios. But how do you make the most of this window before the Fed eventually starts cutting?"

Instead of putting all your cash into a single 12-month CD, you split the amount across various maturities—3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months. This gives you regular access to liquidity while allowing you to benefit from high rates. As each CD matures, you can reinvest it at the prevailing rate or use the cash if needed. This reduces the risk of being\u0027 locked in\u0027 at a lower rate if short-term yields continue to climb."

Short-term Treasury bills are currently yielding more than many bank accounts, and in many states, they are exempt from local taxes. For high earners, this can mean a significant increase in after-tax yield. However, they require a bit more effort to manage than a simple bank account."

Historically, the best time to buy stocks is when yields are high and fear is rampant. The \u0027Quest for Profit\u0027 requires a balanced approach. Keeping 20-30% of your portfolio in cash allows you to sleep at night, but the long-term wealth engine is still the ownership of productive businesses. The key is to avoid \u0027lifestyle creep\u0027 as your interest income grows, and instead, use those returns to compound your future wealth."
