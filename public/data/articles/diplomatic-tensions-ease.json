Both sides have agreed to a temporary moratorium on military exercises in the disputed border region and have established a direct hotline to prevent miscommunication. While far from a permanent treaty, this de-escalation is a massive relief for the region\u0027s markets, which had been pricing in a potential conflict. The S\u0026P Global index rose 2% on the news."
