The narrative has shifted from 'potential' to 'revenue,' validating the massive capital expenditures of the past two years. Analysts at Goldman Sachs upgraded the entire semiconductor sector, revising price targets upward by an average of 20%. 'This is the iPhone moment for enterprise software,' wrote one strategist."

Today, we saw small and mid-cap tech firms joining the party. Companies providing the 'picks and shovels' of the AI gold rush—cooling systems, data center infrastructure, and cybersecurity—are outperforming the indices. This breadth suggests a healthier, more sustainable bull market."

Bears argue that a correction is inevitable, citing rising bond yields as a potential catalyst. But for now, FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) is the dominant sentiment driving liquidity into the market."
