The VIX volatility index has spiked 15% in the last month alone as candidates trade barbs over tax policy, healthcare reform, and tech regulation. Every speech is dissected by algorithms and analysts alike, looking for clues on which sectors will flourish and which will face headwinds. The stark contrast between the leading candidates\u0027 economic platforms makes the stakes higher than usual."
