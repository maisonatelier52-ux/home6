Fraud and looting have plagued the industry for centuries. But a technological revolution is underway. By attaching a secure, blockchain-based \u0027digital twin\u0027 to physical artworks, auction houses and galleries are creating a permanent, immutable record of ownership and condition. This is the end of the forged provenance."

We are seeing platforms that allow everyday investors to diversify into blue-chip art, much like they would into stocks or bonds. This \u0027financialization\u0027 of art is controversial among purists, but it is undoubtedly bringing more liquidity and more eyes to the market."
