The old rule of thumb—buy residential property and wait—is no longer a guaranteed winner in an era of high interest rates and changing work habits. Office space in city centers is facing a \u0027doom loop\u0027 as vacancy rates remain high, while suburban homes and specialized commercial properties are seeing unprecedented demand. For the savvy investor, the \u0027Quest for Profit\u0027 requires a shift in focus from broad market beta to niche alpha."

Similarly, specialized medical facilities and senior living communities are benefiting from the demographic tailwinds of an aging population.

With home ownership becoming unaffordable for many, institutional investors are stepping in to build large-scale, professionally managed rental housing. This offers a more stable and scalable income stream than individual buy-to-let properties. The individual \u0027mom-and-pop\u0027 landlord is being priced out, replaced by REITs and private equity firms."

Real estate is a highly leveraged asset class, and any further hikes from the Fed will put pressure on valuations and debt-service coverage ratios. However, a cooling market also creates opportunities. We are starting to see \u0027distressed sales\u0027 as developers with floating-rate debt are forced to exit. For investors with deep pockets and a long time horizon, 2026 could be the best entry point in a generation."
